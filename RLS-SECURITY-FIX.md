# Row Level Security (RLS) Fix

## Issue Description
The `public.profiles` table and several other tables had RLS enabled but were missing comprehensive security policies, which could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Security Issues Found
1. **profiles table**: Had overly permissive policies (`USING (true)`)
2. **inventory_items table**: Missing DELETE policies
3. **tools table**: Missing comprehensive policies
4. **ppe_items table**: Missing comprehensive policies  
5. **general_items table**: Missing comprehensive policies
6. **faulty_returns table**: Missing comprehensive policies

## Fix Applied

### üîí Comprehensive RLS Policies Implemented

#### Profiles Table
- ‚úÖ **SELECT**: Only authenticated users can view profiles
- ‚úÖ **INSERT**: Only dev users and system can insert profiles
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE**: Users can update own profile, dev users can update any
- ‚úÖ **DELETE**: Only dev users can delete profiles

#### Inventory Tables (inventory_items, tools, ppe_items, general_items, faulty_returns)
- ‚úÖ **SELECT**: Only authenticated users can view items
- ‚úÖ **INSERT**: Only authenticated users can insert items
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE**: Users can update own items, managers/dev/admin can update any
- ‚úÖ **DELETE**: Only managers/dev/admin can delete items

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run the RLS Fix Script
Execute the `supabase-rls-fix.sql` file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-rls-fix.sql`
4. Run the script

### Option 2: Manual Application
If you prefer to apply policies individually, you can run each policy creation statement separately.

## Security Benefits

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Anyone could potentially access profile data
- ‚ùå Missing access controls on inventory operations
- ‚ùå No role-based permissions
- ‚ùå Overly permissive policies

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can access data
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (dev, admin, manager hierarchy)
- ‚úÖ Users can only modify their own records (unless privileged)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive CRUD operation controls
- ‚úÖ System/service role access for automated operations

## Role Hierarchy

1. **dev**: Full access to all operations including user management
2. **admin**: Can manage inventory items but not users
3. **manager**: Can manage inventory items but not users
4. **Other roles**: Can only view and create items, update own items

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, verify:

1. **Profile Access**: Non-authenticated users cannot access profiles
2. **User Management**: Only dev users can create/edit/delete other users
3. **Inventory Management**: Role-based access works correctly
4. **Data Integrity**: All CRUD operations work as expected for authorized users

## Important Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Dev user credentials remain hardcoded and functional
- User management features continue to work properly
- All existing user sessions remain valid
